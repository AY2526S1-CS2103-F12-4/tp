## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonCard`, `DetailedView`, `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

**Main UI Structure:**

* **Header**: Application logo and Help button
* **CommandBox**: Text field for command input with visual error feedback
* **ResultDisplay**: Read-only text area showing command execution results
* **Split Pane** (30% / 70% fixed division):
  * **PersonListPanel** (left): Scrollable list of contacts, each rendered as a `PersonCard` showing index, name, study year, contact details, session tags and subject tags
  * **DetailedView** (right): Comprehensive view of selected contact including all fields, payment status, color-coded subject tags, and color-coded session tags
* **StatusBarFooter**: Displays save file location
* **HelpWindow**: Separate modal dialog with command usage and user guide link

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data via `ObservableList<Person>` so that the UI can be updated automatically.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` objects residing in the `Model`.
* implements keyboard-first interaction:
  * Typing alphanumeric keys anywhere focuses `CommandBox` and inserts the character
  * Typing `ctrl` anywhere focuses `CommandBox`
  * UP/DOWN arrow keys navigate the contact list
  * F1 opens `HelpWindow`
* automatically updates `DetailedView` when a contact is selected (via click or keyboard navigation).

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores a centralized view of all scheduled sessions (which are managed by a `WeeklySessions` object). See the [WeeklySessions Component](#weeklysessions-component) section for implementation details.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
    
### WeeklySessions Component

The `WeeklySessions` component provides a centralized, time-sorted view of all scheduled sessions across all persons in the address book. It augments the `AddressBook` with efficient time-based query capabilities.

#### Purpose
- Maintains a global schedule view of all sessions
- Enables efficient overlap detection
- Supports free time gap-finding algorithms
- Provides sorted session iteration

#### Architecture

`WeeklySessions` implements a dual-storage pattern within `AddressBook`:

1. **Person-centric view**: Sessions stored as `SessionTag` objects within each `Person`'s tags collection
2. **Time-centric view**: Sessions stored in a sorted `TreeSet<Session>` within `WeeklySessions`


#### Key Data Structures

**TreeSet Ordering**: Sessions are automatically sorted using `Session.compareTo()`:
1. By `DayOfWeek` (MON → SUN)
2. Then by `startTime`
3. Then by `endTime`

This ordering enables efficient linear scanning for free time queries.

**Reference Counting**: The `sessionCounts` map tracks how many persons share each session. A session is only removed from the TreeSet when its count reaches zero, preventing premature deletion when multiple students attend the same session time.

#### Core Operations

**Adding Sessions** `add(Session session)`:
- If session already exists: increment reference count
- If new session: add to TreeSet and initialize count to 1

**Removing Sessions** `remove(Session session)`:
- Decrements reference count
- Only removes from TreeSet when count reaches 0

**Overlap Detection** `getOverlap(Session sessionToCheck)`:
- Returns `Optional<Session>` of first overlapping session

**Free Time Search** `getEarliestFreeTime(int duration)`:
- Linear scan from Monday 08:00 to Sunday 22:00
- Finds first gap that fits requested duration
- Returns formatted time string or "No free time available"

**Algorithm Details:**

The algorithm searches for the earliest available time slot by performing a chronological scan through the week:

1. **Search Space Definition:**
   - Days: Monday through Sunday (in order)
   - Time window per day: 08:00 to 22:00 (representing typical working hours)
   - Minimum duration: Specified by user (in minutes)

2. **Day-by-Day Iteration:**
   - For each day of the week (starting from Monday):
     - Initialize current time to 08:00 (earliest possible start time)
     - Filter all sessions for the current day from the sorted TreeSet
     - Sessions are already sorted by start time due to TreeSet ordering

3. **Gap Detection Within Each Day:**
   - For each session on the current day:
     - Calculate gap duration: time between current time and session start time
     - If gap duration ≥ requested duration:
       - A suitable slot is found → return formatted result (e.g., "MON 08:00")
     - Otherwise:
       - Move current time to session end time (skip past this occupied slot)
       - Continue to next session

4. **Final Gap Check:**
   - After processing all sessions for the day:
     - Calculate gap duration: time between current time and 22:00 (end of working hours)
     - If gap duration ≥ requested duration:
       - A suitable slot is found → return formatted result
     - Otherwise:
       - Move to next day and repeat from step 2

5. **No Availability:**
   - If all days are scanned without finding a suitable gap:
     - Return "No free time available for the specified duration."

_Refer to the user guide for example usages_


#### Data Persistence

**Storage Strategy**: Only `Person` objects (with their `SessionTag`s) are serialized to JSON. The `WeeklySessions` TreeSet is not directly persisted.

**Reconstruction on Load** :
When deserializing, `WeeklySessions` is rebuilt from person tags:

This ensures:
- Single source of truth (Person tags in JSON)
- Automatic reference counting during reconstruction
- No data duplication in storage

#### Design Rationale

**Why dual storage?**
- **Person tags**: Efficient person-to-session lookups ("Which sessions does Alice have?")
- **TreeSet**: Efficient time-based queries ("What's the earliest free slot?")

**Why reference counting?**
Multiple students can share the same session time (e.g., group tutoring). Reference counting prevents deletion conflicts.

### Free Feature
The `free` feature is facilitated by `WeeklySessions`. It augments `Addressbook` by providing a centralised time sorted view of all scheduled sessions across all persons. It is stored internally as `weeklySessions` which gives `AddressBooks` two complementary views of session data

The functionality of `WeeklySessions` are exposed to `Addressbook` and the `Model` interface with similar function names:
* `WeeklySessions#add` -> `AddressBook/Model#addSession`
* `WeeklySessions#remove` -> `AddressBook/Model#removeSession`
* `WeeklySessions#set` -> `AddressBook/Model#setWeeklySessions`
* `WeeklySessions#getOverlap` -> `AddressBook/Model#getOverlappingSessions`
* `WeeklySessions#getEarliestFreeTime` -> no change

The sequence diagram for free is similar to `delete` sequence diagram we see in [Logic component](#logic-component), with some key differences:
* Command will be `free DURATION` instead of `delete INDEX`
* Command and its parser will be `Free` instead of `Delete`
* `FreeCommand` will call `Model#getEarliestFreeTime(1)`

The free operation will go through the `Model` component as such:
